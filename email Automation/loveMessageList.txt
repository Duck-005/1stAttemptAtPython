Every moment with you feels like a page ripped from a fairytale, where love writes itself in the stars.
You're my forever in a world where eternity feels too short.

In your eyes, I find the warmth of a thousand suns, and in your smile, the joy of a lifetime.
With you, every heartbeat whispers the sweet melody of love.

Wrapped in the tender embrace of your love, every moment becomes a cherished treasure.
You're the melody in my heart's song, the light that guides me through every dawn.

In your presence, I find solace, in your laughter, my joy blooms.
You're the gentle breeze that soothes my soul and the warmth that fills my heart. Forever grateful for your love.
